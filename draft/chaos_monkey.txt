Bugs have to be

Chaos Monkey

When testing distributed systems a new class of software bugs emerge which
conventional testing procedures may not catch. One inconvenient property of such
bugs are infrequent occurrences and are difficult to reproduce, especially with
code not yet in production.

One counterintuitive approach would be Netflix implementation "Chaos Monkey"
disaster testing system, which operates on Amazons cloud computing platform. It
randomly causes failures of the virtual machine instances, know as *Auto Scaling
Groups*. This puts the distributed systems resiliency at test and functions as a
security measure against netsplits, erratic behavior and failure caused by high
latency and other distributed bugs.

Distributed systems are susceptible to different types of bugs nature than
centralized systems, 

The CAP theorem states that distributed systems cannot provide *Consistency*,
    *Availability* and *Partition tolerance*, all at once.
