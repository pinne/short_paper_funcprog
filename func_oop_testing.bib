@article{identity-theft,
   Abstract = {Identity theft is made possible by the nature of modern
      payment systems. In the modern economy, sellers are willing to offer
         goods and services to strangers in exchange for a promise to pay,
      provided the promise is backed up by data that link the buyer to a
         specific account or credit history. Identity theft involves
         acquiring enough data about another person to counterfeit this link,
      enabling the thief to acquire goods while attributing the charge to
         another person's account. In this article, we discuss what is (and
               is not) known about the prevalence and cost of identity theft,
      describe the institutional framework in which identity theft takes
         place, and consider some of the main policy issues associated with
         the problem. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},
